## Homework 2

Given a matrix of A and a matrix of B, write matrix multiplication function

Example:


#### A

[[2, 3, 1],
 [5, 4, 2],
 [10, 3, 2]]


#### B

[[1, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]


#### C will be:
[[2, 3, 1],
 [5, 4, 2],
 [10, 3, 2]]

in C since we have 1D arrays we will have:
A = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 10, 3, 2]
B = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
C = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 10, 3, 2]
